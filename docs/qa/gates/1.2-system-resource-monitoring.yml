summary: |
  Story 1.2 implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality, comprehensive testing,
  and proper architectural patterns. All previous concerns addressed:
  
  - diskUsage now properly optional and undefined (not hard-coded)
  - Configuration validation exists in config.ts (minimum 1000ms)
  - All 5 acceptance criteria fully satisfied
  - 30/30 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
  - Zero critical issues, 2 advisory observations resolved
  
  Deployment approved with HIGH confidence (95%).
