# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a well-structured monorepo with initial project setup,
**so that** I can begin developing the agent and bot in a clean and organized environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Git repository is initialized.
2. A `README.md` file is created with a basic project description.
3. A monorepo structure is in place (e.g., using npm workspaces) with `packages/agent` and `packages/bot` directories.
4. Each package has its own `package.json` file with basic metadata.
5. A root-level `package.json` manages the workspaces and common dev dependencies (e.g., a linter).

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure
Based on the Unified Project Structure [Source: architecture/section-12-unified-project-structure.md], the exact directory structure must be:

```plaintext

├── tsconfig.base.json          # Shared base TypeScript configuration
└── README.md
```

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/section-3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language**: Node.js 18.x LTS for both agent and bot runtime
- **Build Tool**: npm scripts (v9.x+) for task automation
- **Backend Testing**: Jest 29.x for unit & integration tests
- **Bundler**: esbuild 0.19.x for Cloud Function bundling (bot only)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/section-17-coding-standards.md]
- **Single Source of Truth for Types**: All shared types MUST be defined in `packages/shared-types`
- **Centralized Environment Configuration**: Environment variables should only be accessed in single config file per app
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Files: `kebab-case.ts`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Interfaces: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/section-16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Organization**: Tests co-located in `__tests__` directories or top-level `tests/` folder within each application
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules in isolation, mocking external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between internal modules within applications
- **Framework**: Jest framework for all testing
- **Test Structure Examples**:
  - Bot tests: `apps/bot/src/handlers/__tests__/commands.test.ts`
  - Agent tests: `apps/agent/src/modules/__tests__/IdleManager.test.ts`

### Development Workflow Setup
Initial development commands should work from project root:
- `npm install` - Install all workspace dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start both bot and agent in development mode
- `npm test --workspaces` - Run tests across entire project
- `npm run lint --workspaces` - Lint all packages

## Testing

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test setup for Jest in each workspace
- Test directories created in `apps/agent/tests/` and `apps/bot/tests/`
- Mock setup for external dependencies
- Test scripts configured in each package.json
- Shared test utilities can be created in packages if needed

### Test File Locations
- Bot unit tests: `apps/bot/tests/` or `apps/bot/src/**/__tests__/`
- Agent unit tests: `apps/agent/tests/` or `apps/agent/src/**/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: Within each application's `tests/` folder

### Architecture Compliance - PASS ✅
**Project Structure Adherence:**
- ✅ Exact directory structure matches architecture specification
- ✅ Proper separation of apps/ and packages/ directories
- ✅ Correct workspace naming conventions (@vm-sentinel/* scoping)
- ✅ TypeScript path mapping configured for shared packages

### Technical Standards Assessment - PASS ✅
**Technology Stack Compliance:**
- ✅ Node.js 18.x LTS specified in engines (package.json)
- ✅ npm 9.x+ required in engines
- ✅ Jest 29.x configured for testing framework
- ✅ esbuild 0.19.x configured for bot bundling
- ✅ TypeScript 5.x with strict mode enabled

**Coding Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ ESLint configuration enforces naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type checking
- ✅ Proper workspace dependency management
- ✅ Shared types package implements single source of truth pattern

### Test Strategy Evaluation - CONCERNS ⚠️
**Test Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Jest properly configured across all workspaces
- ✅ Test directories created in both applications
- ✅ Basic test structure established with describe/it blocks
- ⚠️ **CONCERN**: Test files contain only placeholder tests (TODO comments)
- ⚠️ **CONCERN**: No actual test implementation for core functionality

**Test Coverage Assessment:**
- ✅ Test scripts configured in all package.json files
- ✅ Coverage reporting enabled via jest --coverage
- ⚠️ **RISK**: Zero functional test coverage currently

### Code Quality Assessment - PASS ✅
**Shared Types Package:**
- ✅ Comprehensive type definitions for all message types
- ✅ Type guards implemented for runtime type checking
- ✅ Clear documentation and comments
- ✅ Proper export structure following TypeScript best practices

**Configuration Quality:**
- ✅ TypeScript configuration uses strict settings
- ✅ ESLint rules enforce project coding standards
- ✅ Proper module resolution and path mapping
- ✅ Development workflow scripts properly configured

### Risk Assessment - LOW TO MEDIUM RISK 📊
**Low Risk Factors:**
- Solid foundation with proper monorepo structure
- Comprehensive TypeScript configuration
- Clear separation of concerns between packages
- Well-defined shared types preventing data contract issues

**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Placeholder tests provide no validation of core functionality
- No CI/CD pipeline configuration yet (.github/workflows/ empty)
- No integration testing strategy defined

### Non-Functional Requirements - PASS ✅
**Maintainability:**
- ✅ Clear project structure enables easy navigation
- ✅ Shared ESLint configuration ensures consistency
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode prevents common runtime errors

**Scalability:**
- ✅ Monorepo structure supports adding new packages
- ✅ Workspace configuration allows independent versioning
- ✅ Proper dependency management prevents version conflicts

### Quality Gate Decision: PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS 🟡

**RATIONALE:**
The project scaffolding successfully establishes a solid foundation meeting all acceptance criteria. The architecture compliance is excellent, and technical standards are properly implemented. While test placeholders present a concern, this is acceptable for initial scaffolding as actual testing will be implemented in subsequent stories.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement actual tests when developing core functionality
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
3. **LOW PRIORITY**: Consider adding shared utility packages as needed

**APPROVAL STATUS:** Ready for Development ✅
